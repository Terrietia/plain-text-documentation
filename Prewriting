prewriting
Started as stereolithography apparatus, using digital data to make 3d parts
3d printing makes parts layer by layer
use CAD to model and simulate objects
3d printing can make just about anything, just restricted by size
very versatile
still kind of slow, max 450mm/sec
can make a bunch of parts to make a bigger part
