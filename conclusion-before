	AM has potential to replace typical manufacturing methods.
	While there are various disadvantages to AM, technology continues to advance and improve on the various methods of 3D-printing.
	Eventually, there will be a point where AM could make products just as fast as typical manufacturing, as well as just as cheap.
	At that stage, people may not need to buy ready-made products, but just the base materials to use in their 3D-printer at home.
