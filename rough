Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, can be used to make a variety of things. This is important for today's society. Modern factories and workshops are in need of very specific equipment. Creating their equipment requires a lot of money and effort, even for just a prototype. AM can be versatile and fast enough to solve these problems.
AM started from a technology called stereolithography apparatus (SLA). This technology was patented by Charles Hull in 1986. It uses digital data to make an object. Hull successfully created an SLA machine in 1992 and built parts by using a laser beam to trace and cure resin layer by layer. Building layer by layer is the reason additive manufacturing is called such. Nowadays, AM can be done by various methods, such as Selective Laser Sintering, which uses a laser to fuse particles of plastic, glass, or ceramics.
While typical manufacturing techniques are specialized to build a specific part, a 3D-printer can make various objects and parts. The printer isn't restricted by the design of an object, only its size. Regardless of how complex the item is, you can build it with a 3D-printer. However, additive manufacturing is slow compared to typical manufacturing. With our current technology, a 3D printer can print at a max of 450mm/sec. This speed, however, doesn't compare to the versatility of 3D printing. For example, Airbus used to make a piece of a fuel system in 10 different parts combined together, while requiring a technician to oversee the process. With AM, they were able to create that piece in a single print, and didn't need a technician.
